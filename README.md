# mojojojo - A Custom Built WordPress Theme

This is a custom WordPress theme built from scratch to demonstrate theme building principles and techniques. It started out as "Mojo" with Brad Traversy, then expanded to include extra functionality with Andrew Wilson @FollowAndrewEdu via his tutorial on YouTube, courtesy of FreedCodeCamp.org. The name is, of course, a nod to Genndy Tartakovsky's PowerPuff girls!

As a result of the change, there may be some inconsistencies or files that are not required. I will make the necessary changes where necessary.
